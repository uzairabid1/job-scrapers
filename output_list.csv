Nearly every internet connection around the world touches Cisco. We’re the Internet’s optimists. Our technology makes sure the data travels at light speed across connections does so securely, yet it’s not what we make but what we make happen which marks us out. We’re helping those who work in the health service to connect with patients and each other; schools, colleges, and universities to teach in even the most complicated times. We’re helping businesses of all shapes and sizes to connect with their employees and customers in new ways, providing people with access to the digital skills they need and connecting the most remote parts of the world - whether through 5G, or otherwise.

We take on challenges that come our way. We have each other’s backs and recognize our accomplishments as we grow together. We celebrate and support one another - from big and small things in life to big career moments. And giving back is central to our purpose (we get 10 days off each year to do just that).

We know that powering an inclusive future starts with us. Because without diversity and a dedication to equality, there is no moving forward. Our 30 Inclusive Communities, that bring people together around commonalities or passions, are leading the way. Together we’re committed to learning, listening, caring for our communities, whilst supporting the most vulnerable with a collective effort to make this world a better place either with technology, or through our actions.

 The Opportunity
Adobe Developer Platforms has the mission to help Developers “write better software, faster.” Our goal is to provide integrated experiences for technical folks, to streamline the tasks of building, testing, deploying and operating services at scale. We strive to build into all our product offerings strong defaults around security, cost efficiency, reliability and operational observability, to minimize the cognitive load and toil needed to effectively build and run services at web scale.
We build platforms and work to deliver them as an integrated product to our customers, who come in two main classes:
Developers, Site Reliability Engineers, Database Engineers and other technical folks inside Adobe who build our products, our platforms and internal IT systems.
Outside Developers and employees at our customer companies, consultancies and independent software vendors, who are building on, extending and integrating with our products to add new capabilities or to solve unique integration challenges.
For this role, we are looking for someone to lead the infrastructure engineering effort for Adobe’s Developer Platforms team. We seek a self-starter who will drive projects to achieve results and meaningful outcomes. You should be respected as a thought leader, able to influence, persuade and direct sound technical and architectural choices across many teams. You will need to demonstrate executive presence, represent technical direction and architectures to everyone from new grads to C-level executives and do more than talk – you will build and own critical services and deliver them to production.

Speak at industry events, representing Adobe’s Developer Platforms group and our strategy for approaching Developer Experience and Platform Engineering.
Act as a liaison to client and partner engineering teams to share the Developer Platforms mission, vision and roadmap
Gather input on client needs and proposed integration points with technical services which are delivered by our partner organizations
Inspire and encourage our internal customer teams to contribute to Developer Platforms via an internal open source and open contribution model
Review and provide feedback on features, technology, architecture, designs, time & budget estimates, and test strategies
Manage projects risks & engage in creative problem solving
Develop and evolve engineering and business processes to optimize team efficiency
Partner with other teams across Adobe on achieving common goals
What you need to succeed
Deep customer empathy for the Developer as our primary customer stakeholder
Well versed with distributed computing principles and approaches, including Kubernetes
Proven experience building reliable, high-scale, cost-efficient cloud services.
Experience with hands-on DevOps and CI/CD practice on large scale cloud services
Well versed in writing optimized code and architectural patterns for optimization
Strong verbal and written communication skills
12+ years of hands-on development experience
10+ years of experience leading Development Teams
5+ years of experience as a manager of managers and Director-level folks
A commitment to building exceptional, diverse and high-performing teams
Strong persuasion and influence skills

Executive Assistant - Head of EMEA Central Sales
Why We Have This Role
Qualtrics is on the lookout for a proactive individual to assist the Head of EMEA Central Sales and another Executive within the EMEA Leadership team. In this role, your primary focus will be on administrative tasks, while also being given opportunities to support team objectives, basic project coordination, and even take ownership of select projects. This role offers a significant chance for career development and learning. The ideal candidate would be someone who is organised, attentive, and eager to grow professionally. You should be skilled at prioritising tasks and supporting the team efficiently. An understanding of the company's basic goals and guiding the executives towards those objectives will be expected. Adaptability, maintaining confidentiality, and a positive approach will be paramount.
    How You’ll Grow
Interdepartmental Collaboration: Supporting teams across different locations and assisting in driving team initiatives can broaden your organisational reach and deepen your understanding of cross-functional processes. This will foster your ability to work effusively with diverse groups while improving your relationship-building and interpersonal skills.
Process Improvement: The chance to be involved in process improvement initiatives allows for a deeper understanding of the organisation's operations. With time, you'll cultivate problem-solving and analytical skills, and gain a valuable perspective on improving efficiency and productivity within a complex corporate setting.
Task Prioritisation and Time Management: Managing the master schedule and ensuring executives are spending their time effectively requires significant prioritisation and time management skills. Over time, mastering these skills will position you as an efficient manager, a trait valuable not only in this role but throughout your professional journey.
Project Coordination: The role involves opportunities to coordinate specific activities and manage business gatherings - experiences that can significantly advance your project management skills. Witnessing projects from conception to completion, you will understand the challenges and learn how to overcome them.
Communication Skills: Given the nature of the role, constant interactions with different stakeholders at multiple management levels within the organisations, both internally and externally, are inevitable. This will refine your communication skills, particularly in articulating ideas effectively, managing expectations, and resolving conflicts.

Things You’ll Do
Cross Team Collaboration. Playing a crucial role in supporting teams across different locations, you'll ensure smooth communication and even help drive certain team initiatives. The Executive Assistant (EA) will assist with planning and execution of team all hands meetings, offsites, and socials. 
Rhythm of Business Coordination. The EA will manage the master schedule (including annual and quarterly meetings) by arranging meetings and ensuring that the executives are spending their time effectively on the priorities that matter. 
Process Improvement. Part of the day-to-day role for the EA will involve taking over some of the basic process improvement to support the business (e.g. see around corners to proactively solve potential issues and understand if we are making progress in areas necessary to goal completion).

Amazon Web Services is looking for an experienced software development engineer to help define and build the future of cloud computing! This position is a developer role with an EC2 VPC team based in Seattle, WA.

Come join a team engineering core software supporting the massive AWS cloud. We are software engineers and systems development engineers that deliver some of the core EC2 network virtualization systems. The domain is networking, but it’s all about software. Our engineers work in everything from low-level kernel code in C, to userspace in C++, applications in Java and Scala, and automation in Ruby/Python/etc. Our services range from ones responsible for metering all network usage across AWS (billions of records per hour), to low level code delivering encrypted VPN connections, to large-scale web services allowing customers to reconfigure networks at their whim. We’re delivering “API defined networks” at scale. To learn more, check us out here: https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/. We are engaged in all parts of the software development lifecycle from defining to testing new features. We care about both delighting customers and building high quality software. We don't sacrifice one for the other.

This position involves on-call responsibilities typically for one to two weeks every 2-3 months. The first week is primary and the second week is secondary on-call. We don't like to get paged in the middle of the night or on the weekend, so we work to ensure our systems are fault tolerant. When we do get paged, we work together to resolve the root cause to prevent pages for the same issues twice.

We believe good code reviews raise our code quality, grow our technical acumen and provide opportunities to support and share knowledge within the team. We are responsible for supporting our own code in production and we take our code reviews seriously and ship code every day.

A majority of our team has been together for more than two years, and we have developed a strong sense of team trust during that time. We value work life harmony, and support core working hours from 10am to 4pm Pacific. Some of the team starts early and the rest stay later. Our team is dedicated to supporting new team members and encourage curiosity. We are a team of mostly mid-level engineers who enjoy helping junior engineers grow through one-on-one mentoring and thorough, but kind, code reviews. We are looking for a new teammate who is enthusiastic, empathetic, curious, motivated and reliable; someone who will help us build on the team culture we have been cultivating.

We offer comprehensive relocation and benefit packages!

Inclusive Team Culture
- Here at AWS, we embrace our differences. We are committed to furthering our culture of inclusion.
- We have ten employee-led affinity groups, reaching 40,000 employees in over 190 chapters globally.

Amazon’s culture of inclusion is reinforced within our 14 Leadership Principles, which remind team members to seek diverse perspectives, learn and be curious, and earn trust.

Work/Life Balance
- Our team puts a high value on work-life balance. It isn’t about how many hours you spend at home or at work; it’s about the flow you establish that brings energy to both parts of your life. We believe striking the right balance between your personal and professional life is critical to life-long happiness and fulfillment.
- We offer flexibility in working hours and encourage you to find your own balance between your work and personal lives.

Mentorship & Career Growth
- Our team is dedicated to supporting new members. We have a broad mix of experience levels and tenures, and we’re building an environment that celebrates knowledge sharing and mentorship. Our senior members enjoy one-on-one mentoring and thorough, but kind, code reviews.
- We care about your career growth and strive to assign projects based on what will help each team member develop into a better-rounded engineer and enable them to take on more complex tasks in the future

Key job responsibilities
